## Written Homework #3
1. What do Index, New, Create, and Show Routes Do?

Index:

- They are like the home page of the site and display all the 'titles' or categories. 

Example:

<pre><code>
    app.get('/fruits', (req, res) => {
  Fruit.find({}, (err, foundFruits) => {
    if(err){
      console.error(err)
      res.status(400).send(err)
    } else {
      res.render('fruits/Index', {
        fruits: foundFruits
      })
    }
  })
})
</code></pre>

New:

- They display HTML form for creating something new from the index. They use New.jsx to view. 

Create:

- They are the action after a new item is made in the new route/form. It is what actually gets the new item to "create".

Show:

- They display specific items from the index page. For ex, if you were to click on an item in the index page show would display that specific item using Show.jsx.
